MVP Goals:

- As a player, I want to be instructed when to pay attention to the computer so that I am able to repeat the actions back accurately.
- As a player, I want to be instructed when it is my turn so that it is clear when the computer is done with its sequence.
- As a player, I want to be informed when I passed the level so that I am aware of the outcome of my input.
- As a player, I want to be informed when I lost the level so that I am aware of the outcome.
- As a player, when I lose I want to have a button/text to click on to try again so that I have the option of restarting the level.
- As a player, I want to be prevented from inputting my answer while the computer is showing me the sequence so that I do not miss the computer's sequence.
- As a player, I want to be prevented from adding more to my already submitted sequence so that I do not worry about ruining my input.
- As a player, I want the computer to keep track of what level I am on so that I do not have to.
- As a player, I want to be able to have the choice to start a new game so that I can start over if I would like to.

Stretch Goals:

- As a player, I would like the entire screen to let me know when I have beat the level so I can feel a sense of accomplishment. (bronze)
- As a player, I would like an audible tone associated with each color so that I can more accurately remember the sequence. (silver)
- As a player, I would like there to be some animation when a color is clicked so that the UI is more engaging. (silver)
